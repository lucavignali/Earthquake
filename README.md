# Earthquake

As my Country (Italy) has been hit be severe earthquake cases in the past few years, and this morning (30-11-2016) my town (Reggio Emilia) has been hit by a small one (3.7 Magnitude), I thought to apply an example of Spatio-Temporal prediciotn model to earthquake prediction.

This is of course just an exercise to use Spatio-Temporal models to real data.
